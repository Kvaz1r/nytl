The nytl dump
=============

Here go code snippets that are no longer actively needed by nytl or that are just ideas and
not yet ready for their own nytl header. Or stuff that is useless and was just an experiment.

This folder could therefore also be named old, experimental, ideas or snippets.
If you look at older commits there are much more of these, usually in much worse quality than
they are at the moment.
