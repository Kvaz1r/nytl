Those files are not ready to use. Although most of them should work (maybe a few tweaks needed), most of them are here instead of the main header directory, because they are considered useless, buggy or simply are not matures enough.
If you like or need one of those files, or have any improvements for them, let me know.
All of them a licensed under the MIT license, too. Since most of them are just concepts or code snippets from SA, i often forget to add the license explicitly.
